 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."

 BRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The rest of the great Roman Empire in Britain is in shambles. The state of the army is at the image of the administration running it, weak, inneficient, scarce and uninterested in what has become one of Rome's greatest problem, between attacks from bararians and offensive from the Kingdom of Cameliard. After 13 years on the briton front, Manius Macrinus Firmus's mental and physicial health has taken a great hit, eaten by the cold, cloudy weather of Britannia, far from his home, far from Rome, far from his native Macedonia."
 GAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Pellinor is ruling over a land far from united. Wales as always been a land of clanic rulership, and the Roman rule ended with the complete fracturation of the country. However, Pellinor seems to be the figurehead of the welsh culture, sometimes even referred to 'King of Wales'. His son Percival, is promised a great future, and is ready for the call of adventure, whether or not his father approves of it."
